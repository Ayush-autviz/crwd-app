### 🚀 **How to Test**

1. **Start the React Native app**:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios
   # or
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

2. **Navigate to donation**:
   - Tap the Archive icon in the header
   - Or navigate directly to the donation screen

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Try both "Set up donation box" and "One-Time Donation" tabs
   - Adjust donation amounts
   - Select different organizations
   - Review selections and proceed to checkout

### 📁 **Files Created/Modified**

#### New Files:
- `src/screens/DonationScreen.tsx` - Main donation screen
- `src/components/donation/DonationStep2.tsx` - Organization selection
- `src/components/donation/DonationStep3.tsx` - Review selection

The implementation maintains the same design language, user experience, and functionality as your web app while being fully optimized for mobile touch interactions.

**The donation flow is now complete and ready for testing!** 🚀
