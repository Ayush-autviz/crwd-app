# Auth Screens Implementation

This document describes the newly implemented authentication screens for the CRWD React Native app, based on the design of the web version.

## Implemented Screens

### 1. Login Screen (`/src/screens/Login.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Email and password input fields
  - Password visibility toggle (eye icon)
  - Remember me checkbox
  - Google login button (placeholder)
  - "Forgot password?" link
  - Navigation to signup screen
  - Form validation
  - Loading states

### 2. Signup Screen (`/src/screens/Signup.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - First name and last name input fields
  - Email and password input fields
  - Password strength indicator (3-level visual indicator)
  - Password visibility toggle
  - Google signup button (placeholder)
  - Field validation with check marks
  - Terms of service and privacy policy text
  - Navigation to login screen
  - Form validation and loading states

### 3. Forgot Password Screen (`/src/screens/ForgotPassword.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Email input field with mail icon
  - Send verification code functionality
  - Navigation back to login
  - Navigation to signup
  - Form validation
  - Loading states

## Navigation Structure

The auth screens have been added to the main Stack Navigator in `App.tsx`:
- `Login` - Initial auth screen
- `Signup` - Account creation
- `ForgotPassword` - Password recovery
- `DrawerNav` - Main app (after authentication)

## Design Features

### Consistent Styling
- Clean card-based design with shadows
- Consistent color scheme using app constants
- Responsive layout with KeyboardAvoidingView
- Professional typography and spacing

### User Experience
- Smooth transitions between screens
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Loading states for all async operations
- Proper keyboard handling

### Accessibility
- Proper labels for form inputs
- Semantic button roles
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader friendly

## Usage

### Starting with Auth
The app now starts with the Login screen. Users can:
1. Sign in with existing credentials
2. Navigate to Signup to create new account
3. Use "Forgot password?" to recover account
4. After successful authentication, navigate to main app

### Navigation Flow
```
Login Screen
├── → Signup Screen
├── → Forgot Password Screen
└── → Main App (DrawerNav)

Signup Screen
├── → Login Screen
└── → Main App (DrawerNav)

Forgot Password Screen
├── → Login Screen
├── → Signup Screen
└── → Reset Password (future implementation)
```

## Integration Notes

### API Integration
Currently, the screens use simulated API calls with `setTimeout`. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Replace the simulated API calls in each screen's submit handlers
2. Add proper error handling for network requests
3. Implement token storage for authentication state
4. Add authentication context/provider

### Google Authentication
The Google login buttons are implemented with placeholders. To add real Google auth:

1. Install `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`
2. Configure Google Sign-In for iOS and Android
3. Replace the placeholder handlers with actual Google Sign-In logic

### State Management
Consider adding authentication state management using:
- React Context + useReducer
- Redux Toolkit
- Zustand
- Or similar state management solution

## Customization

### Colors
All colors are imported from `/src/Constants/Colors.tsx`. Update this file to change the color scheme.

### Styling
Each screen has its own StyleSheet. Modify the styles object in each component to customize appearance.

### Validation
Form validation logic can be found in each screen's submit handlers. Extend as needed for your specific requirements.

## Testing

To test the auth screens:
1. Run the app: `npm start` or `yarn start`
2. The app will start on the Login screen
3. Test form validation by submitting empty forms
4. Test navigation between screens
5. Test loading states and success/error alerts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the auth screens:
1. Biometric authentication (TouchID/FaceID)
2. Social login (Facebook, Apple, etc.)
3. Email verification flow
4. Password strength requirements customization
5. Multi-factor authentication
6. Remember me functionality with secure storage
7. Auto-login on app restart
