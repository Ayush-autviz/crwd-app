# ✅ Manage Donation Box - ADDED!

## 🎯 **What Was Missing:**
You were right! I had forgotten to implement the **Manage Donation Box** component that appears when users tap the "Manage" button in the checkout screen.

## ✅ **What I Added:**

### **New Component: ManageDonationBox.tsx**
Location: `src/components/donation/ManageDonationBox.tsx`

#### **Features Implemented:**
1. ✅ **Header with Back Button** - Navigate back to checkout
2. ✅ **Blue Summary Card** with:
   - Editable donation amount (tap to edit)
   - Increment/decrement controls
   - Payment schedule ("on the 26th of every month")
   - "Edit amount" and "Edit payment" buttons
   - "See full transaction history" link
3. ✅ **Edit Causes Button** - For modifying selected organizations
4. ✅ **Causes List** showing:
   - Organization images/placeholders
   - Organization names and usernames
   - Remove functionality for each cause
5. ✅ **Allocation Note** - "Allocations will automatically adjust for 100% distribution"
6. ✅ **Footer Actions**:
   - "Deactivate donation box" option
   - "Save" button to confirm changes
7. ✅ **Alert Dialogs** for:
   - Remove cause confirmation
   - Save confirmation
   - Deactivate confirmation

#### **Design Features:**
- ✅ **Mobile-Optimized UI** - Touch-friendly controls
- ✅ **Consistent Styling** - Matches web app design
- ✅ **Interactive Elements** - Tap-to-edit amount, remove buttons
- ✅ **Visual Feedback** - Proper button states and transitions

### **Integration:**
- ✅ **Connected to CheckoutScreen** - Manage button now opens ManageDonationBox
- ✅ **Proper Navigation** - Back button returns to checkout
- ✅ **State Management** - Handles amount editing and cause management

## 🔄 **How It Works:**

1. **From Checkout Screen:**

   - User can remove causes by tapping "Remove" next to each organization
   - User can tap "Edit Causes" to modify their selection
   - User can view transaction history
   - User can save changes or deactivate the donation box

3. **Navigation:**

   - All changes are preserved

## 🚀 **Testing the Manage Feature:**
