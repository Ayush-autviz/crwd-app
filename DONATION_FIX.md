# üîß Donation Import Issue - FIXED!

## ‚ùå **Issue:**
```
Unable to resolve module ../../constants/organizations from /Users/mac/Desktop/crwd_app/src/components/donation/DonationStep3.tsx
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution:**
The issue was with the import path. I created the organizations file in the wrong directory.

### **Problem:**
- Created file in: `src/constants/organizations.ts` (lowercase 'c')
- But existing folder is: `src/Constants/` (uppercase 'C')

### **Fix Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Moved `organizations.ts` to correct location: `src/Constants/organizations.ts`
2. ‚úÖ Updated all import statements in donation components:
   - `src/components/donation/DonationStep2.tsx`
   - `src/components/donation/DonationStep3.tsx` 
   - `src/components/donation/OneTimeDonation.tsx`
   - `src/components/donation/CheckoutScreen.tsx`

### **Correct Import Statement:**
```typescript
import { CROWDS, RECENTS, SUGGESTED, Organization } from '../../Constants/organizations';
```

## üöÄ **Status: RESOLVED**

All donation components now have correct imports and should work properly. The donation flow is ready for testing!

### **Next Steps:**
1. Run the React Native app: `npx react-native run-ios` or `npx react-native run-android`
2. Tap the Archive icon in the header
3. Test the complete donation flow

The module resolution error is now fixed and the donation functionality should work seamlessly! üéâ
